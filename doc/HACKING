So, you are interested in hacking new exitmap modules?  Modules are basically
Python files in the directory src/modules/.  When invoked, a module engages in
some sort of network interaction.  Examples are resolving a domain, logging
into a remote machine, or requesting a web page.  All network interaction is
routed over a specific exit relay.

From an implementation point of view, there are two types of modules:

1. There are modules which only make use of Python libraries such as
   socket.gethostbyname() for name resolution or urllib2 for web interaction.
   The network traffic generated by these modules is transparently tunneled
   over SOCKS by a patched version of SocksiPy which is part of this
   distribution.

2. Modules can invoke external tools such gnutls-cli to fetch X.509
   certificates.  Similarly, a patched version of torsocks is used to
   transparently tunnel this type of network traffic over Tor's SOCKS port.

To get an idea of what a module looks like in practice, have a look at the file
src/modules/dummy.py.  The file contains comments which explain the API.
